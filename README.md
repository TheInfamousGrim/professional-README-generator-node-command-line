## Description

The purpose of this CLI application is to help a developer to quickly generate a README.md template that they can then update at a later date manually.

Rather than having a dev simply copy and paste a template over from a saved template they might have on github, they can install this application to their local repository. Then they run the application, fill in some prompts and hesto presto the README template is there ready to be edited.
